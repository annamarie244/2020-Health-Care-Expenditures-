#  This dashboard allows you to see the portions of our heath care system with the highest cost. Could allow you to work with proper distributions for cost when dealing with health care cost. So there isn't so much of a problem I am trying to solve but my idea was this would be useful as a planning source. 


#  I uploaded the data from excel and deleted the null variables. There wasn't much to do to prepate the data after uploading it. 

# I think in the future I could add multiple years to see the change in our health care prices. I think maybe in the future I could narrow it down to North Carolina and look at the distribution throughout the state.
